# Automated-General-Report-for-Portfolio-Risk-Analysis
This repository provides an advanced Quantitative Risk Report focused on evaluating the stability and efficiency of a diversified investment portfolio. The analysis utilizes high-frequency risk metrics and statistical tests to validate the portfolio's resilience against market shocks and systematic risk.

Objective: To implement a robust risk management framework using conditional volatility and tail risk metrics to optimize capital preservation.

Extended Version
This project contains a comprehensive quantitative evaluation of a multi-asset portfolio during a high-volatility period (August 2025 to November 2025). The analysis integrates performance attribution and advanced risk modeling—such as Backtesting VaR and Rolling Kurtosis—to identify regime changes in market risk.

Key Objectives of the Analysis
•	Dynamic Risk Measurement: Monitoring of 21-day Rolling Volatility and Rolling Kurtosis to detect "Volatility Clustering" and leptokurtic shifts (tail risk).
•	Tail Risk & Expected Shortfall: Calculation of Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional VaR (CVaR) at 95% and 99% levels to quantify the severity of extreme loss scenarios.
•	Model Validation: Implementation of VaR Backtesting with an Empirical Failure Rate (4.35%) to validate the statistical calibration of risk models.
•	Risk-Adjusted Efficiency: Evaluation through Sharpe (1.68), Sortino (2.53), and Calmar (4.69) ratios to ensure superior return per unit of downside risk.
Performance Attribution: Weekly asset contribution analysis and Jensen's Alpha calculation to isolate active management results.

Assets Analyzed
The portfolio employs a strategic mix of growth and defensive instruments:
•	Individual Equities (Alpha Drivers): Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), JPMorgan (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS).
•	Fixed Income (Stabilizer): Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND), acting as a primary risk hedge with low/negative correlation to equities.
•	Benchmarks: SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA).

Key Portfolio Results
•	Cumulative Performance: Total return of 6.66% (16.67% YTD), reaching an All-Time High (ATH) of 110.5% during the trend recovery phase.
•	Systematic Risk: Beta of 0.91 and $R^2$ of 77.51%, indicating lower sensitivity to market volatility than the SPY benchmark.
•	Alpha Generation: Jensen's Alpha of 7.36%, confirming significant value creation above the benchmark.
•	Drawdown Management: Maximum Drawdown contained at -5.34% with rapid intraday recovery, demonstrating high liquidity and effective defensive positioning.

Code Structure & Logic
The reporting engine is structured to process raw pricing data and generate conditional insights:
•	Volatility & Regime Detection: Uses rolling windows to identify regime shifts (e.g., the jump from 0.06 to 0.14 annualized volatility).
•	Statistical Engine: Performs Jarque-Bera tests and distribution analysis (Skewness: -0.27, Kurtosis: 0.47) to assess the viability of Gaussian vs. t-Student risk models.
•	Correlation & Diversification: Generates an asset correlation matrix to monitor the "BND buffer" effect and sector-specific dependencies.

Technologies/Concepts Used
•	Quantitative Finance: Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), Risk Budgeting, and Performance Attribution.
•	Risk Modeling: VaR/CVaR Rolling, Backtesting, and Volatility Clustering analysis.
•	Python Stack: (Implicit) Pandas/NumPy for matrix operations, Matplotlib/Seaborn for Heatmaps and Rolling charts.
•	Economic Context: Integration of macro events (Fed cuts, trade tariffs) into quantitative price action analysis.
